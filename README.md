# pushups-bot

(Current) Rules:
1. Doing 30 pushups gives you a 'point' and removes 1 'nomination' (you cannot have less than 0 'nominations' by doing this)
2. Pushups must be videorecorded and verified by at least one moderator before they will award 'points'
3. The first time you receive a 'point' you gain an additional 'point'
4. You may lose/use a 'point' to 'nominate' another person (you cannot have less than 0 'points' by doing this)
5. When a person is 'nominated', they gain 1 'nomination' (see rule 1)
