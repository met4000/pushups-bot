# pushups-bot


(Current) Rules:
1. Doing 30 pushups gives you a 'point' (and removes 1 'nomination'; you cannot have less than 0 'nominations' by doing this)
2. The first time you receive a 'point' you gain an additional 'point'
3. You may lose/use a 'point' to 'nominate' another person (you may not have less than 0 'points' by doing this)
4. When a person is 'nominated', they gain 1 'nomination' - equivalent to doing 30 pushups (see (1.))
